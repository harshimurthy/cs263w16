Collaborative Single point Event Updation and Calendar sync

**Problem**

 UCSB has more than 30 departments and each department hosts various multidisciplinary workshops and events that may be of interests to students of different departments. The only way to get to know about events that occur in different departments is by regularly checking their website. But, itâ€™s not a feasible solution since students neither have the time nor the patience to check so many links. Also, there is no easy way to know events happening at a particular time so that when students are free, they can pay a visit to such events

**Solution** 

The project proposal is to design and develop a web application which acts as a single point of contact between various departments and students from different backgrounds. This way, many students get involved in university activities and keep themselves updated about the events that occur in the university. Also, using Google Calendar API, one can sync their calendar and the application will show the events that goes on in their free time 


**Overview of design and plan**

The application will include two main type of users. One, the students who only check the updates and events. Two, the people in charge of creating the events. Also, each user can sync with Google calendar and obtain notifications about the events during their free time.The plan is to first implement the basic functionalities and gradually update it to add advanced features.

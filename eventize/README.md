##Eventize

##Problem

UCSB has more than 30 departments and each department hosts various multidisciplinary workshops and events that may be of interests to students of different departments. The only way to get to know about events that occur in different departments is by regularly checking their website. But, itâ€™s not a feasible solution since students neither have the time nor the patience to check so many links. Also, there is no easy way to know events happening at a particular time so that when students are free, they can pay a visit to such events

There is no single point medium to share blogs or experience about the university.

##Solution

The project proposal is to design and develop a web application which acts as a single point of contact between various departments and students from different backgrounds. This way, many students get involved in university activities and keep themselves updated about the events that occur in the university. Also, the application allows users to share their experiences in the university.

##Overview of design and plan

The application will include three main features for each of the task involved.

    Addition
    View all existing items
    View ones own items
    Delete the items you have created.
